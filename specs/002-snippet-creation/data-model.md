# Data Model: Snippet Creation

## Entities

### Snippet

- **Description**: Represents a saved code snippet with metadata and content.
- **Storage table**: `snippets`

#### Fields

- `id` (string / integer): Primary key, auto-generated by SQLite (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT).
- `title` (string): Required; 1-100 characters; cannot be whitespace-only.
  - DB Type: `TEXT` with a CHECK constraint on length (enforced in migrations and application layer).
- `content` (string): Required; 1-50,000 characters; preserves all whitespace and invisible characters; stored exactly as entered except line endings normalized to LF.
  - DB Type: `TEXT`
- `created_at` (datetime): Automatically set on insert; stored as ISO 8601 text.
- `updated_at` (datetime): Automatically set on insert/update; stored as ISO 8601 text.

#### Validation Rules (enforced in both client and server)

- Title: required, trimmed length between 1 and 100, cannot be whitespace-only.
- Content: required, length between 1 and 50,000 characters; whitespace-only content is invalid.
- Line endings: normalize to LF on save; do not remove or alter other whitespace or invisible characters.

## Relationships

- None for this feature (tags and languages are out of scope and handled by separate features).

## State Transitions

- New Snippet: created -> stored with `created_at` and `updated_at` set to current time.
- Update Snippet (out of scope): would update `content`, `title`, and `updated_at`.

## Example SQL Migration (concept)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS snippets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(length(title) <= 100),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Notes

- Validation is performed before inserting into DB; the DB has complementary constraints but remains permissive for content to allow full content storage.
- Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
